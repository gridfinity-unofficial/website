          "question": "How to cut down on printing time?",
          "answer": "If possible, use a bigger nozzle such as 0.6 because many parts of gridfinity are not too intricate and therefore allow for a bigger nozzle. Additionally, many maker spaces have 3D printers, which you could use to parallelize tasks."

          "answer": "Just about anything will work: CA adhesive, VHB tape, sticky putty, etc. If you don't want to make anything sticky, you can also pad out the remaining space in your drawer so the grid doesn't slide around."

          "answer": "CA adhesive, superglue, and hot-glue all work well! Just remember that magnets are polarized so you need to be consistent with orientation. "
